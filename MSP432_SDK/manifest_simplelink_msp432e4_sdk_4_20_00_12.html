Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.

Like<br>`assert.string(myArg, "myArg")`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks<br>like this:<br><br>```javascript<br>    var assert = require("assert-plus");<br><br>    function fooAccount(options, callback) {<br>        assert.object(options, "options");<br>        assert.number(options.id, "options.id");<br>        assert.bool(options.isManager, "options.isManager");<br>        assert.string(options.name, "options.name");<br>        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, "options.email");<br>        assert.func(callback, "callback");<br><br>        // Do stuff<br>        callback(null, {});<br>    }<br>```<br><br># API<br><br>All methods that *aren"t* part of node"s core assert API are simply assumed to<br>take an argument, and then a string "name" that"s not a message; `AssertionError`<br>will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:<br><br>    AssertionError: foo (string) is required<br>    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)<br>    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)<br>    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)<br>    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)<br>    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)<br>    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)<br>    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)<br>    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)<br><br>from:<br><br>```javascript<br>    function test(foo) {<br>        assert.string(foo, "foo");<br>    }<br>```<br><br>There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:<br><br>```javascript<br>    function test(foo) {<br>        assert.arrayOfString(foo, "foo");<br>    }<br>```<br><br>You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):<br><br>```javascript<br>    assert.optionalString(foo, "foo");<br>```<br><br>Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the<br>environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have<br>lots of assertions, and don"t want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in<br>production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are<br>also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with<br>implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still<br>does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.<br><br>On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which<br>avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate<br>watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been<br>specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much<br>more than needed.<br><br>## Getting started<br>Install with npm:<br><br>```sh<br>npm install chokidar<br>```<br><br>Then `require` and use it in your code:<br><br>```javascript<br>var chokidar = require("chokidar");<br><br>// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles<br>chokidar.watch(".", {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on("all", (event, path) => {<br>  console.log(event, path);<br>});<br>```<br><br>```javascript<br>// Example of a more typical implementation structure:<br><br>// Initialize watcher.<br>var watcher = chokidar.watch("file, dir, glob, or array", {<br>  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,<br>  persistent: true<br>});<br><br>// Something to use when events are received.<br>var log = console.log.bind(console);<br>// Add event listeners.<br>watcher<br>  .on("add", path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))<br>  .on("change", path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))<br>  .on("unlink", path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));<br><br>// More possible events.<br>watcher<br>  .on("addDir", path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))<br>  .on("unlinkDir", path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))<br>  .on("error", error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))<br>  .on("ready", () => log("Initial scan complete.

Paths to files, dirs to be watched<br>recursively, or glob patterns.<br>* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:<br><br>#### Persistence<br><br>* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process<br>should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to<br>`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted<br>after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.<br><br>#### Path filtering<br><br>* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)<br>Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is<br>tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it<br>gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second<br>time with two arguments (the path and the<br>[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)<br>object of that path).<br>* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while<br>instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).<br>* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the<br>symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following<br>the link references and bubbling events through the link"s path.<br>* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be<br>derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.<br>* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as<br>literal path names, even if they look like globs.<br><br>#### Performance<br><br>* `usePolling` (default: `false`).<br>Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling<br>leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is<br>typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over<br>a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other<br>non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the<br>`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable<br>to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.<br>* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)<br>  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also<br>    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.<br>  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system<br>  polling for binary files.<br>  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))<br>* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the<br>`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly<br>and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When<br>set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.<br>* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the<br>[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)<br>object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set<br>this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn"t<br>already available from the underlying watch events.<br>* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of<br>subdirectories will be traversed.<br>* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).<br>By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before<br>the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`<br>events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,<br>especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the<br>write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.<br>Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,<br>holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a<br>configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily<br>dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should<br>be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.<br>Use with caution.<br>  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust<br>  timing params:*<br>  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in<br>  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.<br>  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.<br><br>#### Errors<br>* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files<br>that don"t have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`<br>or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.<br>* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).<br>Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use<br>"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is<br>re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event<br>rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well<br>for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in<br>milliseconds.<br><br>### Methods & Events<br><br>`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:<br><br>* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.<br>Takes an array of strings or just one string.<br>* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.<br>Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,<br>`raw`, `error`.<br>Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event<br>name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.<br>* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.<br>Takes an array of strings or just one string.<br>* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.<br>* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file<br>system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object"s keys are all the<br>directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the<br>values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.<br><br>## CLI<br><br>If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out<br>[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to<br>execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.<br><br>## Install Troubleshooting<br><br>* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`<br>  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is<br>    not indicative of a problem.

Useful in circumstances like preventing accidental double-clicks<br>  on a "submit" button from firing a second time.<br><br>  The debounced function returned has a property "clear" that is a <br>  function that will clear any scheduled future executions of your function.<br><br>  The debounced function returned has a property "flush" that is a <br>  function that will immediately execute the function if and only if execution is scheduled,<br>  and reset the execution timer for subsequent invocations of the debounced<br>  function.<br><br>## License<br><br>  MIT<br><br>  Original implementation is from [`underscore.js`](http://underscorejs.org/)<br>  which also has an MIT license.<br><br>===== debug@2.2.0 =====<br># debug<br><br>  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core"s debugging technique.<br><br>## Installation<br><br>```bash<br>$ npm install debug<br>```<br><br>## Usage<br><br> With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you"re used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.<br><br>Example _app.js_:<br><br>```js<br>var debug = require("debug")("http")<br>  , http = require("http")<br>  , name = "My App";<br><br>// fake app<br><br>debug("booting %s", name);<br><br>http.createServer(function(req, res){<br>  debug(req.method + " " + req.url);<br>  res.end("hello\n");<br>}).listen(3000, function(){<br>  debug("listening");<br>});<br><br>// fake worker of some kind<br><br>require("./worker");<br>```<br><br>Example _worker.js_:<br><br>```js<br>var debug = require("debug")("worker");<br><br>setInterval(function(){<br>  debug("doing some work");<br>}, 1000);<br>```<br><br> The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:<br><br>  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)<br><br>  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)<br><br>#### Windows note<br><br> On Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command.<br><br> ```cmd<br> set DEBUG=*,-not_this<br> ```<br><br>Then, run the program to be debugged as usual.<br><br>## Millisecond diff<br><br>  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.<br><br>  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)<br><br>  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:<br><br>  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)<br><br>## Conventions<br><br> If you"re using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".<br><br>## Wildcards<br><br>  The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect:compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.<br><br>  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:".<br><br>## Browser support<br><br>  Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. Consider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`, and wish to debug both. Somewhere in the code on your page, include:<br><br>```js<br>window.myDebug = require("debug");<br>```<br><br>  ("debug" is a global object in the browser so we give this object a different name.) When your page is open in the browser, type the following in the console:<br><br>```js<br>myDebug.enable("worker:*")<br>```<br><br>  Refresh the page. Debug output will continue to be sent to the console until it is disabled by typing `myDebug.disable()` in the console.<br><br>```js<br>a = debug("worker:a");<br>b = debug("worker:b");<br><br>setInterval(function(){<br>  a("doing some work");<br>}, 1000);<br><br>setInterval(function(){<br>  b("doing some work");<br>}, 1200);<br>```<br><br>#### Web Inspector Colors<br><br>  Colors are also enabled on "Web Inspectors" that understand the `%c` formatting<br>  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version<br>  31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))<br>  and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).<br><br>  Colored output looks something like:<br><br>  ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/71256/3139768/b98c5fd8-e8ef-11e3-862a-f7253b6f47c6.png)<br><br>### stderr vs stdout<br><br>You can set an alternative logging method per-namespace by overriding the `log` method on a per-namespace or globally:<br><br>Example _stdout.js_:<br><br>```js<br>var debug = require("debug");<br>var error = debug("app:error");<br><br>// by default stderr is used<br>error("goes to stderr!");<br><br>var log = debug("app:log");<br>// set this namespace to log via console.log<br>log.log = console.log.bind(console); // don"t forget to bind to console!<br>log("goes to stdout");<br>error("still goes to stderr!");<br><br>// set all output to go via console.info<br>// overrides all per-namespace log settings<br>debug.log = console.info.bind(console);<br>error("now goes to stdout via console.info");<br>log("still goes to stdout, but via console.info now");<br>```<br><br>### Save debug output to a file<br><br>You can save all debug statements to a file by piping them.<br><br>Example:<br><br>```bash<br>$ DEBUG_FD=3 node your-app.js 3> whatever.log<br>```<br><br>## Authors<br><br> - TJ Holowaychuk<br> - Nathan Rajlich<br><br>## License<br><br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2014 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the<br>"Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including<br>without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,<br>distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to<br>permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to<br>the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be<br>included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.<br>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY<br>CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,<br>TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE<br>SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.<br><br>===== debug@2.6.9 =====<br>(The MIT License)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2014 TJ Holowaychuk <tj@vision-media.ca><br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software <br>and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, <br>including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, <br>and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,<br>subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial <br>portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT <br>LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. <br>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, <br>WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE <br>SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.<br><br><br>===== decode-uri-component@0.2.0 =====<br>The MIT License (MIT)<br><br>Copyright (c) Sam Verschueren <sam.verschueren@gmail.com> (github.com/SamVerschueren)<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It runs on both CommonJS runtimes<br>(e.g. [nodejs]) and in a web browser.<br><br>ipaddr.js allows you to verify and parse string representation of an IP<br>address, match it against a CIDR range or range list, determine if it falls<br>into some reserved ranges (examples include loopback and private ranges),<br>and convert between IPv4 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.<br><br>[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org<br><br>## Installation<br><br>`npm install ipaddr.js`<br><br>or<br><br>`bower install ipaddr.js`<br><br>## API<br><br>ipaddr.js defines one object in the global scope: `ipaddr`. In CommonJS,<br>it is exported from the module:<br><br>```js<br>var ipaddr = require("ipaddr.js");<br>```<br><br>The API consists of several global methods and two classes: ipaddr.IPv6 and ipaddr.IPv4.<br><br>### Global methods<br><br>There are three global methods defined: `ipaddr.isValid`, `ipaddr.parse` and<br>`ipaddr.process`. All of them receive a string as a single parameter.<br><br>The `ipaddr.isValid` method returns `true` if the address is a valid IPv4 or<br>IPv6 address, and `false` otherwise. It does not throw any exceptions.<br><br>The `ipaddr.parse` method returns an object representing the IP address,<br>or throws an `Error` if the passed string is not a valid representation of an<br>IP address.<br><br>The `ipaddr.process` method works just like the `ipaddr.parse` one, but it<br>automatically converts IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses to their IPv4 counterparts<br>before returning. It is useful when you have a Node.js instance listening<br>on an IPv6 socket, and the `net.ivp6.bindv6only` sysctl parameter (or its<br>equivalent on non-Linux OS) is set to 0. In this case, you can accept IPv4<br>connections on your IPv6-only socket, but the remote address will be mangled.<br>Use `ipaddr.process` method to automatically demangle it.<br><br>### Object representation<br><br>Parsing methods return an object which descends from `ipaddr.IPv6` or<br>`ipaddr.IPv4`. These objects share some properties, but most of them differ.<br><br>#### Shared properties<br><br>One can determine the type of address by calling `addr.kind()`. It will return<br>either `"ipv6"` or `"ipv4"`.<br><br>An address can be converted back to its string representation with `addr.toString()`.<br>Note that this method:<br> * does not return the original string used to create the object (in fact, there is<br>   no way of getting that string)<br> * returns a compact representation (when it is applicable)<br><br>A `match(range, bits)` method can be used to check if the address falls into a<br>certain CIDR range.<br>Note that an address can be (obviously) matched only against an address of the same type.<br><br>For example:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8:1234::1");<br>var range = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::");<br><br>addr.match(range, 32); // => true<br>```<br><br>Alternatively, `match` can also be called as `match([range, bits])`. In this way,<br>it can be used together with the `parseCIDR(string)` method, which parses an IP<br>address together with a CIDR range.<br><br>For example:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8:1234::1");<br><br>addr.match(ipaddr.parseCIDR("2001:db8::/32")); // => true<br>```<br><br>A `range()` method returns one of predefined names for several special ranges defined<br>by IP protocols. The exact names (and their respective CIDR ranges) can be looked up<br>in the source: [IPv6 ranges] and [IPv4 ranges]. Some common ones include `"unicast"`<br>(the default one) and `"reserved"`.<br><br>You can match against your own range list by using<br>`ipaddr.subnetMatch(address, rangeList, defaultName)` method. It can work with a mix of IPv6 or IPv4 addresses, and accepts a name-to-subnet map as the range list. For example:<br><br>```js<br>var rangeList = {<br>  documentationOnly: [ ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::"), 32 ],<br>  tunnelProviders: [<br>    [ ipaddr.parse("2001:470::"), 32 ], // he.net<br>    [ ipaddr.parse("2001:5c0::"), 32 ]  // freenet6<br>  ]<br>};<br>ipaddr.subnetMatch(ipaddr.parse("2001:470:8:66::1"), rangeList, "unknown"); // => "tunnelProviders"<br>```<br><br>The addresses can be converted to their byte representation with `toByteArray()`.<br>(Actually, JavaScript mostly does not know about byte buffers. They are emulated with<br>arrays of numbers, each in range of 0..255.)<br><br>```js<br>var bytes = ipaddr.parse("2a00:1450:8007::68").toByteArray(); // ipv6.google.com<br>bytes // => [42, 0x00, 0x14, 0x50, 0x80, 0x07, 0x00, <zeroes...>, 0x00, 0x68 ]<br>```<br><br>The `ipaddr.IPv4` and `ipaddr.IPv6` objects have some methods defined, too. All of them<br>have the same interface for both protocols, and are similar to global methods.<br><br>`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` can be used to check if the string is a valid address<br>for particular protocol, and `ipaddr.IPvX.parse(string)` is the error-throwing parser.<br><br>`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` uses the same format for parsing as the POSIX `inet_ntoa` function, which accepts unusual formats like `0xc0.168.1.1` or `0x10000000`. The function `ipaddr.IPv4.isValidFourPartDecimal(string)` validates the IPv4 address and also ensures that it is written in four-part decimal format.<br><br>[IPv6 ranges]: https://github.com/whitequark/ipaddr.js/blob/master/src/ipaddr.coffee#L186<br>[IPv4 ranges]: https://github.com/whitequark/ipaddr.js/blob/master/src/ipaddr.coffee#L71<br><br>#### IPv6 properties<br><br>Sometimes you will want to convert IPv6 not to a compact string representation (with<br>the `::` substitution); the `toNormalizedString()` method will return an address where<br>all zeroes are explicit.<br><br>For example:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:0db8::0001");<br>addr.toString(); // => "2001:db8::1"<br>addr.toNormalizedString(); // => "2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1"<br>```<br><br>The `isIPv4MappedAddress()` method will return `true` if this address is an IPv4-mapped<br>one, and `toIPv4Address()` will return an IPv4 object address.<br><br>To access the underlying binary representation of the address, use `addr.parts`.<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8:10::1234:DEAD");<br>addr.parts // => [0x2001, 0xdb8, 0x10, 0, 0, 0, 0x1234, 0xdead]<br>```<br><br>A IPv6 zone index can be accessed via `addr.zoneId`:<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::%eth0");<br>addr.zoneId // => "eth0"<br>```<br><br>#### IPv4 properties<br><br>`toIPv4MappedAddress()` will return a corresponding IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.<br><br>To access the underlying representation of the address, use `addr.octets`.<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("192.168.1.1");<br>addr.octets // => [192, 168, 1, 1]<br>```<br><br>`prefixLengthFromSubnetMask()` will return a CIDR prefix length for a valid IPv4 netmask or<br>false if the netmask is not valid.<br><br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.parse("255.255.255.240").prefixLengthFromSubnetMask() == 28<br>ipaddr.IPv4.parse("255.192.164.0").prefixLengthFromSubnetMask()  == null<br>```<br><br>`subnetMaskFromPrefixLength()` will return an IPv4 netmask for a valid CIDR prefix length.<br><br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.subnetMaskFromPrefixLength(24) == "255.255.255.0"<br>ipaddr.IPv4.subnetMaskFromPrefixLength(29) == "255.255.255.248"<br>```<br><br>`broadcastAddressFromCIDR()` will return the broadcast address for a given IPv4 interface and netmask in CIDR notation.<br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.broadcastAddressFromCIDR("172.0.0.1/24") == "172.0.0.255"<br>```<br>`networkAddressFromCIDR()` will return the network address for a given IPv4 interface and netmask in CIDR notation.<br>```js<br>ipaddr.IPv4.networkAddressFromCIDR("172.0.0.1/24") == "172.0.0.0"<br>```<br><br>#### Conversion<br><br>IPv4 and IPv6 can be converted bidirectionally to and from network byte order (MSB) byte arrays.<br><br>The `fromByteArray()` method will take an array and create an appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 object<br>if the input satisfies the requirements. For IPv4 it has to be an array of four 8-bit values,<br>while for IPv6 it has to be an array of sixteen 8-bit values.<br><br>For example:<br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.fromByteArray([0x7f, 0, 0, 1]);<br>addr.toString(); // => "127.0.0.1"<br>```<br><br>or<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.fromByteArray([0x20, 1, 0xd, 0xb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])<br>addr.toString(); // => "2001:db8::1"<br>```<br><br>Both objects also offer a `toByteArray()` method, which returns an array in network byte order (MSB).<br><br>For example:<br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("127.0.0.1");<br>addr.toByteArray(); // => [0x7f, 0, 0, 1]<br>```<br><br>or<br><br>```js<br>var addr = ipaddr.parse("2001:db8::1");<br>addr.toByteArray(); // => [0x20, 1, 0xd, 0xb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]<br>```<br><br>===== is-accessor-descriptor@0.1.6 =====<br>The MIT License (MIT)<br><br>Copyright (c) 2015, Jon Schlinkert.<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br>copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br>furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br>all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Poppers?<br><br>A popper is an element on the screen which "pops out" from the natural flow of your application.  <br>Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.<br><br><br>## So, yet another tooltip library?<br><br>Well, basically, **no**.  <br>Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element<br>to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  <br><br>The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**<br>(similar to middlewares or plugins).  <br>The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).<br><br>Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  <br>It"s used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).<br><br>### Popper.js<br><br>This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to<br>the poppers.<br><br>Some of the key points are:<br><br>- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn"t mess with your DOM!);<br>- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;<br>- Supports Shadow DOM elements;<br>- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;<br><br>Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!<br><br>Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).<br><br><br>### Tooltip.js<br><br>Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,<br>we created **Tooltip.js**.  <br>It"s a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  <br>Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be<br>easy to integrate it in your projects.  <br>The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.<br><br>Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).<br><br><br>## Installation<br>Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:<br><br>| Source |                                                                                  |<br>|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br>| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |<br>| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |<br>| NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |<br>| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |<br>| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |<br>| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |<br><br>Tooltip.js as well:<br><br>| Source |                                                                                  |<br>|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br>| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |<br>| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |<br>| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |<br>| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |<br>| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |<br><br>\*: Bower isn"t officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  <br>For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).<br><br>### Dist targets<br><br>Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.<br><br>- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;<br>- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;<br>- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;<br><br>Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.<br><br>## Usage<br><br>Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button<br><br>```js<br>var reference = document.querySelector(".my-button");<br>var popper = document.querySelector(".my-popper");<br>var anotherPopper = new Popper(<br>    reference,<br>    popper,<br>    {<br>        // popper options here<br>    }<br>);<br>```<br><br>### Callbacks<br><br>Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after<br>the popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.<br><br>```js<br>const reference = document.querySelector(".my-button");<br>const popper = document.querySelector(".my-popper");<br>new Popper(reference, popper, {<br>    onCreate: (data) => {<br>        // data is an object containing all the informations computed<br>        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow<br>        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation<br>    },<br>    onUpdate: (data) => {<br>        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates<br>    }<br>});<br>```<br><br>### Writing your own modifiers<br><br>Popper.js is based on a "plugin-like" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated "modifiers".  <br>A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  <br><br>To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)<br><br><br>### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration<br><br>Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because<br>they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  <br>Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,<br>you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using<br>your library of choice.  <br><br>For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing<br>frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.<br><br>Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and<br>integrate Popper.js by yourself!<br><br>```js<br>function applyReactStyle(data) {<br>    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper<br>};<br><br>const reference = document.querySelector(".my-button");<br>const popper = document.querySelector(".my-popper");<br>new Popper(reference, popper, {<br>    modifiers: {<br>        applyStyle: { enabled: false },<br>        applyReactStyle: {<br>            enabled: true,<br>            fn: applyReactStyle,<br>            order: 800,<br>        },<br>    },<br>});<br><br>```<br><br>### Migration from Popper.js v0<br><br>Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to<br>Popper.js v1.  <br><br>https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62<br><br>Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.<br><br>### Performances<br><br>Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper"s position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  <br>This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.<br><br>## Notes<br><br>### Libraries using Popper.js<br><br>The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to<br>be used in 3rd party libraries.  <br><br>Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.<br><br><br>### Credits<br>I want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did:<br><br>- [@AndreaScn](https://github.com/AndreaScn) for his work on the GitHub Page and the manual testing he did during the development;<br>- [@vampolo](https://github.com/vampolo) for the original idea and for the name of the library;<br>- [Sysdig](https://github.com/Draios) for all the awesome things I learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library;<br>- [Tether.js](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world;<br>- [The Contributors](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/graphs/contributors) for their much appreciated Pull Requests and bug reports;<br>- **you** for the star you"ll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try ??<br><br>### Copyright and license<br>Code and documentation copyright 2016 **Federico Zivolo**.

Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.<br><br>The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.<br><br>### Breaking changes from 2.x<br><br>URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.<br><br>### Breaking changes from 1.x<br><br>The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.<br><br>## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))<br><br>Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

For the purposes<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br> <br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License.

If You<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br> <br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>      meet the following conditions:<br> <br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br> <br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>          stating that You changed the files; and<br> <br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>          the Derivative Works; and<br> <br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br> <br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br> <br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br> <br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br> <br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br> <br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br> <br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br> <br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br> <br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br> <br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.

For the purposes<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br><br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>      meet the following conditions:<br><br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>          stating that You changed the files; and<br><br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>          the Derivative Works; and<br><br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br><br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br><br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don"t include<br>      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate<br>      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a<br>      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the<br>      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier<br>      identification within third-party archives.<br><br>   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]<br><br>   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");<br>   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.<br>   You may obtain a copy of the License at<br><br>       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0<br><br>   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software<br>   distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.<br>   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and<br>   limitations under the License.<br><br>  <br><br></span></div>
