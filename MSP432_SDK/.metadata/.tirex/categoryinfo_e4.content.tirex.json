The boot loader can be built to use either the UART, SSI, I2C, CAN, Ethernet, or USB ports to update the code on the microcontroller. The boot loader is customizable via source code modifications, or simply deciding at compile time which routines to include.

These examples are similar to the examples in examples/rtos and examples/nortos but they use SysConfig to generate configuration code instead of having the application provide it. SysConfig is integrated with logic to help manage, expose and potentially solve conflicts visually to free up more time for creating differentiated applications. Use of the SysConfig preview examples is not required for developing on SimpleLink devices. However, we encourage you to try them out and to give us your feedback. More information on SysConfig can be found in the SysConfig section of the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's Guide. See the \"System Configuration Basics\" lab in <a href='http://www.ti.com/wireless-connectivity/simplelink-solutions/overview/simplelink-academy.html'>SimpleLink Academy</a> for step-by-step instructions for installing and using SysConfig</p>"
