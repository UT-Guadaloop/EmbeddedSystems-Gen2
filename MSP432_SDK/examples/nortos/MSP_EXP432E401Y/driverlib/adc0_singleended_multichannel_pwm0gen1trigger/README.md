# MSP432E4 Example project for ADC with multiple channel and single sequencer with PWM Trigger

In this application example the ADC0 is configured for a single sequencer sampling 4 channels
 in single ended mode. The ADC is triggered by the PWM-0 Generator-2 match event. The PWM is
 generating an output of 1.8 kHz with 50% duty cycle. Every Match on the PWM generator will 
 cause an ADC trigger to be generated causing the sequencer to perform the conversion and on
 completion an interrupt is generated by the ADC Sequencer. The data is read by the CPU to be
 displayed on the serial console.
