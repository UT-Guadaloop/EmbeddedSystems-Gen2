# MSP432E4 Example project for ADC with multiple channel and single sequencer with Analog Comparator Trigger

In this application example the ADC0 is configured for a single sequencer sampling 4 channels in single 
 ended mode. The ADC is triggered by a Analog Comparator detecting a threshold crossing. The sequencer
 performs the conversion and on completion an interrupt is generated by the ADC Sequencer. The data is 
 read by the CPU to be displayed on the serial console.
