# MSP432E4 Example project for ADC with single channel and single sequencer

In this application example the ADC0 is configured for a single sequencer 
 sampling a single channel in single ended mode. The ADC channel is configured
 for sample and hold of 32. Thus the total sampling time of the signal is 4+32 
 clock cycles. The data is then displayed on the serial console.
