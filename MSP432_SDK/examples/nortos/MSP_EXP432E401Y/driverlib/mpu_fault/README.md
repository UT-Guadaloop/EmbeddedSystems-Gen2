# MPU Fault

This example application demonstrates the use of the MPU to protect a
region of memory from access, and to generate a memory management fault
when there is an access violation.

UART0, connected to the ICDI virtual COM port and running at 115,200,
8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
