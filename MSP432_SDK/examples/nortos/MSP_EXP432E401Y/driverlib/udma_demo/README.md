# uDMA

This example application demonstrates the use of the uDMA controller to
transfer data between memory buffers, and to transfer data to and from a
UART.  The test runs for 10 seconds before exiting.

UART0, connected to the ICDI virtual COM port and running at 115,200,
8-N-1, is used to display messages from this application.
