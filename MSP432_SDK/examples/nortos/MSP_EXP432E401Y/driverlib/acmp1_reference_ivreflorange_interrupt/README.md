# MSP432E4 Example Project for Analog Comparator

In the application Analog Comparator 1 is configured to generate an interrupt
 when the input signal is higher than the Internal reference voltage from the
 Lo value ladder. At the same time the comparator digital output also changes
 when the input crossed the trigger value. When the input crosses the reference
 the LED D1 is lit. The User Switch SW2 can be used to reset the state of the LED.
