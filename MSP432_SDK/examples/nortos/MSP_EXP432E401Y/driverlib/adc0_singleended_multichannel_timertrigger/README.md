# MSP432E4 Example project for ADC with multiple channel and single sequencer with Timer Trigger

In this application example the ADC0 is configured for a single sequencer sampling 4 channels
 in single ended mode. The ADC is triggered by a timer running in periodic mode with a sampling
 frequency of 10 KHz. After the conversion is completed an interrupt is generated by the ADC 
 Sequencer and the data is read by the CPU to be displayed on the serial console.
