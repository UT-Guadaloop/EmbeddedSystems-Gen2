# MSP432E4 Example project for ADC with multiple channel and single sequencer with GPIO Trigger

In this application example the ADC0 is configured for a single sequencer sampling 4 channels
 in single ended mode. The ADC is triggered by a GPIO press. Every GPIO press creates a trigger
 causing the sequencer to perform the conversion and on completion an interrupt is generated by
 the ADC Sequencer. The data is read by the CPU to be displayed on the serial console.
