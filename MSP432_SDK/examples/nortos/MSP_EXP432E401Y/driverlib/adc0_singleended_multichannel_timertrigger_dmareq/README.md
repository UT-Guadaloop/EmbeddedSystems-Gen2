# MSP432E4 Example project for ADC with multiple channel and single sequencer with Timer Trigger and DMA Request from ADC.

In this application example the ADC0 is configured for a single sequencer sampling 4 channels in single ended mode. 
 The ADC is triggered by a timer running in periodic mode with a sampling frequency of 1 KHz. After the conversion
 is completed a DMA request is generated by the ADC Sequencer. The data is read by the DMA and an interrupt request
 to the CPU is generated. The CPU reads the data from the DMA buffer and re-enables the DMA to transfer more data.
